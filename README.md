# ML Basics Notebook

This notebook serves as a foundational project in Machine Learning, demonstrating key concepts such as statistics, visualization, classification, regression, and clustering. It was developed to practice and consolidate the core techniques used in ML, making it a useful reference for anyone starting their ML journey.

## Why This Project

The main objective was to build a **foundation** in ML by experimenting with different algorithms and understanding **how they work on simple datasets**. It’s a reference point for anyone who’s just starting out and wants to quickly skim through the basics of ML with code examples.

## Contents

The Jupyter Notebook (`ml_basics.ipynb`) and (`ml_basics_part2_classification`)includes:

* 📊 **Statistics with NumPy & SciPy**

  * Mean, Median, Mode
  * Standard Deviation, Variance
  * Random data generation

* 📈 **Data Visualization with Matplotlib**

  * Histograms
  * Scatter plots

* 🤖 **Machine Learning Algorithms**

  * Classification: Decision Trees, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  * Regression: Linear & Polynomial Regression
  * Clustering: K-Means basics

* 🏆 **Model Evaluation**

  * Accuracy
  * Confusion Matrix
  * Classification Reports
