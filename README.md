# ML Basics Notebook

This project contains a Jupyter notebook (`ml_basics.ipynb`) demonstrating fundamental concepts in statistics and data visualization using Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

## Contents
- Calculating mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance with NumPy and SciPy
- Generating random data with NumPy
- Visualizing data using Matplotlib (histograms, scatter plots)
- Performing linear and polynomial regression

## Requirements
- Python 3.1 >
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (for polynomial regression and RÂ² score)

Alternatively, you can use the Anaconda distribution, which includes all the required packages:
- [Anaconda Individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

## Usage
1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```
   Or install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), which comes with all these packages pre-installed.
2. Open `ml_basics.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run the cells to explore the examples.
