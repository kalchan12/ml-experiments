# ML Basics Notebook

This notebook series serves as a foundational project in Machine Learning, demonstrating key concepts such as statistics, visualization, classification, regression, and clustering. It was developed to practice and consolidate the core techniques used in ML, making it a useful reference for anyone starting their ML journey.

## Why This Project

The main objective was to build a foundation in ML by experimenting with different algorithms and understanding how they work on simple datasets. It’s a reference point for anyone who’s just starting out and wants to quickly skim through the basics of ML with code examples.

## Contents

The Jupyter Notebooks included are:

* **ml\_basics.ipynb** → Core ML concepts (statistics, visualization, regression, clustering)
* **ml\_basics\_part2\_classification.ipynb** → Introductory classification algorithms (Decision Trees, Random Forest, kNN, SVM)
* **ml\_basics\_part3\_classification.ipynb** → Extended classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, XGBoost, ROC Curve visualization)

### 📊 Statistics with NumPy & SciPy

* Mean, Median, Mode
* Standard Deviation, Variance
* Random data generation

### 📈 Data Visualization with Matplotlib

* Histograms
* Scatter plots

### 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms

**Classification**

* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Naive Bayes
* AdaBoost
* XGBoost

**Regression**

* Linear Regression
* Polynomial Regression

**Clustering**

* K-Means basics

### 🏆 Model Evaluation

* Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix
* Classification Reports
* ROC Curve & AUC
* R² Score

## Requirements

* Python 3.1 >
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* xgboost

Alternatively, you can use the **Anaconda distribution**, which includes most of the required packages.

## Usage

1. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost
   ```

   Or install **Anaconda**, which comes with most of these pre-installed.

2. Open any notebook (`ml_basics.ipynb`, `ml_basics_part2_classification.ipynb`, `ml_basics_part3_classification.ipynb`) in **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code**.

3. Run the cells to explore the examples.
